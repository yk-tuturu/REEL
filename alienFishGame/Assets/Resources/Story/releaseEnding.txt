As you readied your fishing rod, you felt a hint of hesitation. 


The Overlord might be your supposed rival.. but the consequences of defeating him are still unknown.
set13.3

If the overlord truly claimed to be the ancestor of all fish, what consequences would arise if you killed it here? 


What if the ecosystem became permanently damaged? What if the seemingly neverending supply of fish disappeared due to the death of their leader? 

You
... How am I going to make a living if I can't fish anymore? 

Overlord
Have you finally come to your senses, human? Have you finally noticed the repercussions of your actions? 


You didn't particularly feel your intentions were evil, But you understood the hurt this creature must be feeling.

You
Fine. I won't kill you. But promise you won't come back and hurt us again.

The overlord opened its three mouths, seemingly in protest, then hesitated. It reluctantly gritted its sharp teeth. 

Overlord
That is... a deal. But you must refrain from taking even more fish away from my seas. 

You
We'll try to control ourselves. 
moveDown

Even though you weren't too sure how much of those words you truly meant.


For humans, there will always be a need for fish. The fish market has, and will likely, run forever. 

You
But even so, I guess we should try our best...

After a fierce, spontaneous battle, you decide to let The Overlord swim free.


After all, these are its waters. Why would you want to disrupt the balance of nature?


You and the other fishermen watch as the creature dives under the surface.


Its two tail fins shimmer as the distant sun rises above the horizon.


Despite everything, you feel a sense of respect for this ancient being and its unwavering strength.


It only wanted to protect its home, just as you did.


Together, you can find that balance you both wish for.


Maybe you and The Overlord are more alike than you think.
