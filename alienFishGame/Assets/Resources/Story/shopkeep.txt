Anythin' good from the sea today?
Seen some weeeeird fish out there, man. Whatcha got?
Got anything new for me?
Catch any dinner for me?
Lookin' for an upgrade?
I can hook you up with some fresh new rods and traps. Whad'ya think?
Hope my men out there ain't causin' ya too much trouble, rookie.
Don't get too close to the edge of the dock; heard there's strange things in these waters.
You can tune a guitar, but you can't tuna fishâ€¦ unless you play bass.
Always think like a fish, no matter how weird it gets.
