?????
Who dares lay a finger on my underlings??
shake, playOverlordSnarl

The colossal figure you had just summoned from the depths snarles, visibly steaming with rage.


This could've just been a typical calm night of fishing. Maybe you shouldn't have bought that suspicious bait from the shopkeeper after all. 

Overlord
They call me the ruler of the seas, the elder of all fish--

Overlord
You tarnish these waters with your barbaric actions. You've taken hundreds of my underlings away from their home, and yet you feel no remorse. 
shakeBoss

You didn't understand. You were only trying to make a living. Just as people needed food and income, so did you.

You
I was just doing my job. 

Overlord
Poor excuses. How would you feel if I devoured this dock as we speak? Would you remain indifferent? Yet that would be incomparable to the casualties my kingdom has suffered. 
set10, moveUp

The destruction it proposed didn't seem favorable. Where else would you fish if this entire dock was wiped out?

You
Calm down... maybe we can talk this out?
 
Overlord
This injustice shall not go unpunished. You shall suffer the wrath of The Overlord!!

There is no room for argument. All you can do is prepare what equipment you have and attack.
