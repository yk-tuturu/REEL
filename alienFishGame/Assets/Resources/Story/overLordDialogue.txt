?????
Who dares lay a finger on my underlings??

The shadowy figure you had just fished up from the depths snarled, clearly displeased at this predicament.


This could've just been a usual Monday afternoon. Maybe you shouldn't have bought that suspicious bait from the shopkeeper after all. 

Overlord
They call me the ruler of the sea, the lord of all fish--

Overlord
And yet you dare tarnish these sacred waters with your filthy hands. You've taken thousands of my underlings away from their homeland, and yet you feel no remorse. 


You didn't understand. You were just trying to make a living. Just as people needed food on their tables and money to pay their bills, so did you. 

You
I was just doing my job. 

Overlord
Flimsy excuses. How would you feel if I devoured everything on this dock right now? Would you remain unconcerned? And yet this is nothing compared to the casualties you have caused to my kingdom.

The hypothetical situation they described didn't seem too good. Where else would you fish if this entire dock was gone?

You
Calm down... maybe we can talk this out?
 
Overlord
This injustice must be punished. All of you shall suffer the wrath of the fish!!

There didn't seem to be any room for argument. All you could do was to prepare what equipment you have and attack.
